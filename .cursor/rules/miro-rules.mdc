# Positioning Nested Items with `relativeTo`

Whenever an item is nested within another object (such as a frame), the item's `position` object **must** include a `relativeTo` attribute.

## Instructions

1. If the item is placed directly on the canvas (no `parentId` is provided), set:
   - `relativeTo: "canvas_center"`
2. If the item is nested inside another object (a `parentId` is provided), set:
   - `relativeTo: "parent_top_left"`

## Rationale
This ensures correct positioning of items relative to their parent or the canvas, as required by the Miro API.

## Examples

```jsonc
// Nested inside a parent (e.g., a frame)
{
  "position": {
    "x": 100,
    "y": 200,
    "relativeTo": "parent_top_left" // when parentId is provided
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// Placed directly on the canvas
{
  "position": {
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0,
    "relativeTo": "canvas_center" // when no parentId is provided
  }
}
```

# Fitting Nested Items Within Parent Objects

When adding an item to a parent (for example, a sticky note to a frame), you **must**:

1. Set the item's `geometry.width` so that the item fits within the confines of the parent object.
2. Adjust the item's `style.fontSize` (measured in dp) to a smaller value if necessary, so the content fits within the available width.

## Rationale
This ensures that nested items are visually contained within their parent and that their content remains readable and unclipped.

## Example

```jsonc
// Example: Adding a sticky note to a frame
{
  "geometry": {
    "width": 200 // Set so the sticky note fits inside the frame
  },
  "style": {
    "fontSize": 12 // Reduce font size as needed to fit content
  },
  "parent": {
    "id": "frame-123"
  }
}
```
